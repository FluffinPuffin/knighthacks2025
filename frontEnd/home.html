                <p>We are a group of students who haave known eachother since highschool. While we might be in different
                    colleges and majors, that doesn't stop us from collaberating with eachother. We each bring different
                    skill sets to the table in order to create amazing projects together.</p>

                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>Originally we were aiming to build some sort of gambling app. However, that didn't pan out.
                    Instead, we ended up really interested in the <em>PheraTech</em> challenge. While the
                    challenge specifies
                    to do it in a simulation, we have someone who likes drones. So we thought why not build it in real
                    life?
                    We carried that theme of making digital things real. This webapp takes what you draw online and
                    draws it in real life with the help of a custom drone.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>We aim to make drawing more accessible. We wanted to create a <em>scaleable project</em>.</p>

                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                <p>The front-end of Pi-Casso is built with the simple tools of <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>,
                    and <em>JavaScript</em>. No
                    need for a fancy framework that over complicates everything.
                    Pi-Casso's back-end is built in <em>Python</em> and <em>C++</em>.
                    The drone (Pablo) is built with an <em>Arduino</em> + <em>Raspberry Pi** </em>. It is
                    fueled by a power
                    bank. A few of the parts are 3D printed. There might be some <em>Legos</em> thrown in as well.
                    The drone
                    was made during KnightHacks.
                    It was built with burnt hands and tears.</p>
